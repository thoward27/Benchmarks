# Compiler Benchmarks

This is a small, temporary repository that provides a Python Wrapper over cBench. 

> This repo is going to be deprecated as soon as I can get [CK](https://github.com/ctuning) to work properly.

For now, it serves as a way to interact with the cBench programs pythonically, that is all.
